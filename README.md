VBA Homework

Hello readers!

This is for an assignment running through an excel data file to populate a report.  I have encounted a few issues, notably the following:

There are some calculations that are hitting the error 6 overflow when i run it.  It is a bug i am trying to figure out, as it works with the test data, but the real data hit a snag. 

Going about in creating the header and report in a new sheet.  Would i create a new sheet and then go back to the active sheet? - I believe I can accomplish this to generate a report page. 

Looping the worksheet loop to run through all the worksheets ends up generating an error. (bottom comments)

Anyways... as I work on improving skills, I hope to update this to make it look better and cleaner.
